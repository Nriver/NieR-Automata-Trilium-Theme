# NieR-Automata-Trilium-Theme
A fan made NieR: Automata style theme for [Trilium Notes](https://github.com/zadam/trilium). (I was going to make a lesser bright solarized light theme, and somehow this come out.)

Tested with Trilium 0.47.3

# How to use
Download the latest release and import the zip file into your note. Choose the 'NieR Automata' theme in the cofiguration and restart Trilium, you should be good to go.

# Credits
Thanks to the solarized light theme from [trilium-solarized-theme](https://github.com/WKSu/trilium-solarized-theme) and this interesting [codepen](https://codepen.io/lgkonline/pen/WpMRQG) to make the base of this theme.
