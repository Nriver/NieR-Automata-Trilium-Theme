# How to use
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/Nriver/NieR-Automata-Trilium-Theme/releases) and import the zip file into your note. Choose the 'NieR Automata' theme in the cofiguration and restart Trilium, you should be good to go.

# Credits
Thanks to the solarized light theme from [trilium-solarized-theme](https://github.com/WKSu/trilium-solarized-theme) and this interesting [codepen](https://codepen.io/lgkonline/pen/WpMRQG) to make the base of this theme.
